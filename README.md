# Guess-Number

This Python program is a simple **number guessing game** where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10, and the user tries to guess it.

## 🎯 How It Works

- The program generates a random integer between 1 and 10.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- The program gives hints if the guess is too high or too low.
- The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number.
- Once guessed correctly, it congratulates the user.

## 📁 File

- `guess-number.py`: Contains the game logic.

## ▶️ How to Run

Run the program with Python 3:

```bash
python guess-number.py
